# Sootify and Pooflix projects
Projects done to while I was studying OOP concepts.

### Spootify
It's a OOP based terminal aplication where I learned various concepts. Its a terminal application that lets you:
  * Create playlists
  * Update playlists (removing or adding songs)
  * List playlists and its contents

### Pooflix
It's also an OOP based terminal aplication, but a little bit more complex and using swing to create a simple UI. It's based on the funcionality of  "Netflix" and the user can: 
  * Add movies, series and actors 
  * See the list of actors, movies and series
  * Update series (adding episodes or removing them)
  * Shows a list of perfomances from specific actor
